## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r students}
students <- read.csv("https://userpage.fu-berlin.de/soga/200/2010_data_sets/students.csv")
summary(students)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = students, aes(x = nc.score, y = salary, col = age))+
         geom_point()+
         ylab("Salary")+
         xlab("Score")+
         facet_wrap(~students$gender)+
         labs(title = "This graph shows how the scores have an effect on salaries.
              Graph is divided into two parts for male and female. Because their
              salaries are different from each other and we should see this
              difference on graph. As a result, the graph colorized by age and
              showed that the average salary of male students is higher than female
              students with the same score.")+
         theme_light()

ggplot(students, aes(x = semester, col = gender, fill = gender)) + 
      geom_bar()+
      labs(title = "This graph shows which major lessons male and female students
           take according to the semesters. As a result, Biology,Political Science
           and Social Science lessons  were taken more by female students.In the
           same way,Economics and Finance, Mathematics and Statistics lessons were
           taken more bymale students.On the other hand, Environmental Sciences
           lesson was taken almost equally.")+
      facet_wrap(~students$major)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
