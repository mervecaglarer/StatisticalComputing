#binomial probabilities
# Suppose there are twelve multiple choice questions in an English class quiz. 
# Each question has five possible answers, and only one of them is correct. 
# Find the probability of having four or less correct answers if a student attempts 
# to answer every question at random.

# Since only one out of five possible answers is correct, the probability 
# of answering a question correctly by random is 1/5=0.2. We can find the 
# probability of having exactly 4 correct answers by random attempts as follows.
#P(X=4)=?
dbinom(4, size=12, prob=0.2) 

# To find the probability of having four or less correct answers by random attempts, 
# we apply the function dbinom with x = 0,â€¦,4.
#P(X>=0)=?

#Poisson distribution
# If there are twelve cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, 
# find the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the 
# bridge in a particular minute.

#The probability of having exactly sixteen cars crossing the bridge in 
# a particular minute is given by the function ppois.
#P(X=16)=?
dpois(16, 12)

# The probability of having sixteen or less cars crossing the bridge in 
# a particular minute is given by the function ppois.
# If there are twelve cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, 
# find the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the 
# bridge in a particular minute.
#P(X>16)=?
ppois(16, 12)

# Hence the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge 
# in a minute is in the upper tail of the probability density function
#P(X>16)=1-P(X<=16)
